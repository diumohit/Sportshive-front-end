                <ol>
                    <li>Manager
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Manager sets up the club and makes sure that everything is running. Manager can add new
                                athletes as well as other coaches and managers. Profiles of all people in the club are

                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Coach
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Coaches manage their training groups (athletes, schedules, attendance tracking, etc.)
                                and can only see the contact and profile information of athletes in their training
                                groups. Managers can limit the visibility of such information if needed. Coaches can add
                                new athletes to their own training groups.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Athlete
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Basic access – Athletes can see the training information added by their Club. Athletes
                                get access to their basic accounts after a manager or a coach adds their email addresses
                                to their profiles. Athletes can access their schedules, profile and other relevant
                                information from the Sportlyzer Player App (mobile app) by authenticating themselves
                                with the email that was added to their profiles by their coach or manager.</li>

                            <li>Advanced diary access - There is another layer for athletes who need to log, plan and
                                analyze their training themselves. Such access has to be separately given by a coach or
                                a manager. Alternatively, such account can be created and used individually, without
                                being connected to any clubs.</li>

                        </ol>
