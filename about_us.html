        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <div class="___about-section">

            <p>Sportshive is the place where people can search and sign up for local leagues, tournaments, and clinics, learn about successful athletes, access training programs and drills, and get expert advice.
            We cater youth sports athletes, parents, coaches, club administrators, and fans, publishing new content each day across a wide variety of sports-related topics.Sports are life-changing activities that instill important qualities into athletes and build lasting friendships and memories. Participating in sports teaches teamwork, leadership, and social skills, as well as respect, humility, and discipline—many of us were taught these qualities by coaches and volunteers of sports organizations that we were a part of growing up. We are forever grateful for their impact on our lives—they were, and often still are, our heroes.At Sportshive, we build applications and services to help the heroes of today spend less time on the administrative activities of their organization and more time teaching the qualities of Sport to their athletes. They inspire every one of us every single day. Everything we do, we do for the Love of Sport.Engage Sports was founded by parents who are actively involved in youth sports as coaches and board members. We have leveraged our 20 + years of technology experience and developed a company focused on completely streamlining the administrative process of running and managing every aspect of a sports organization.
