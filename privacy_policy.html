                    they choose to track, without a written consent, and use it for further developments of the
                    Service
                    and to publish it for scientific purposes.</p>

                <p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, Sportshive will not intentionally disclose (personal)
                    data that is stored in the Service to any other third parties without User’s freely given,
                    specific,
                    informed and unambiguous consent. Sportshive may disclose information to third parties if a User
                    gives consent for doing so, as well as in the following circumstances:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Sportshive uses sub-processors, when necessary, to offer Service to the Users, including but
                        not
                        limited to support, server and messaging service providers. In addition, Sportshive uses
                        customer relations management software (CRM) to offer better support to Clubs, get a better
                        overview of them and to activate them faster. The third parties needed to offer the Service
                        are
                        mostly located in Europe. Sportshive has evaluated that all the other data processors also
                        offer
                        sufficient data protection. Third parties are only sent the minimum required amount of data.
                    </li>

                    <li>Sportshive may disclose Personal Data or other information if required to do so by law.</li>

                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>The storage period</h2>
                <p>Server service provider backs up data once a day and those copies are kept for 2 weeks.
                    Sportshive
                    also retains Personal Data to comply with legal obligations (i.e. billing information is
                    retained
                    for a period of 7 years in accordance with the Estonian accounting and taxation laws), resolve
                    disputes and enforce agreements. Sportshive makes backups once a week and these are kept for 6
                    months. Where Sportshive no longer needs to store Personal Data for the purposes set out in this
                    Privacy Policy, all Personal Data will be deleted from Sportshive’s servers.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>The rights of the data subjectn</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Users have the right to access their Personal Data stored in Sportshive any time, by logging
                        into their account or accessing it from the mobile apps. Users have the right to correct or
                        update their account information any time by accessing their account. Users have the right
                        to
                        require erasure of their account/data in Sportshive. To delete an account, User can contact
                        Sportshive by sending an email/message as set forth in point 1 of this Privacy Policy and
                        Sportshive will delete all data concerning User’s account. Sportshive deletes the account
                        (including Personal Data) within 30 days after receiving the request. If User’s account is
                        linked with a Club, User should ask their Club to delete their data.</li>

                    <li>Users have the right to object to the processing of their Personal Data by sending
                        Sportshive an
                        email as set forth in point 1 of this Privacy Policy with their objection. Users also have
                        the
                        right to restrict processing of the data whilst complaints (for example, about accuracy) are
                        resolved, or if the processing is unlawful, but the User objects to erasure. Further
                        instructions and activities rely upon the specific request. Accounts are mainly linked with
                        a
                        Club and the processing is often required by the Club to provide their services.</li>

                    <li>
                        Users have the right to export their data from Sportshive. They can export most of their
                        data
                        themselves. For any other requests User should contact Sportshive by email as set forth in
                        point
                        1 of this Privacy Policy. Sportshive exports data in structured, commonly used and
                        machine-readable format (i.e. in CSV or Excel, or if possible, in XML). Sportshive exports
                        data
                        within 30 days after receiving the request.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Data security</h2>
                <p>Sportshive maintains appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect
                    Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized
                    alteration,
                    unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the
                    Personal
                    Data in Sportshive’s possession. This includes, for example, password protection, resilience of
                    processing systems, backing up Personal Data and https connection with encryption. Please note
                    that
                    Sportshive cannot guarantee full security for unauthorized entry or use of User’s account
                    password
                    or User’s software or hardware failure. If User believes that their personal data has been
                    compromised, they should contact Sportshive immediately as set forth in point 1 of this Privacy
                    Policy.</p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</h2>

                <p>If User finds that his/her rights have been violated, User has the right to submit a claim to
                    Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate (e-mail: info@aki.ee or phone +372 627 4135) or other
                    supervisory authority in Member State User’s habitual residence, place of work or place of the
                    alleged infringement or court.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Processing of children’s data</h2>
                <p>Users under the age of 16 need to provide parental consent to use the Service. If someone under
                    16
                    has provided personal information to the Service without parental consent, reasonable efforts
                    are
                    used to restrict processing of such information in the Service until parental consent is
                    attained.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Communication in relation to data breaches</h2>
                <p>In case of a Personal Data breach, Sportshive will without undue delay, and where feasible,
                    notify
                    the Users and authorities in accordance with applicable law.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Emails from Sportshive</h2>
                <p>
                    Sportshive informs that occasional emails are sent about important events in the Service or
                    related
                    to it. Emails are sent to the email address User has submitted to the Service. Sportshive does
                    not
                    use User emails for sending third-party advertisements.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Cookies</h2>

                <p>Sportshive uses third-party analytics tools (mainly Google Analytics) which helps to measure
                    traffic
                    and usage trends on Sportshive’s website. These tools collect analytics information from Users
                    so
                    that it cannot be reasonably used to identify any particular individual User.</p>

                <p>For additional website usage data, Sportshive also uses two types of cookies - session ID cookie
                    and
                    language cookie. They will not be shared with any other organization.</p>

                <p>Session ID cookie is a unique number that is assigned to a User upon webpage visit and allows to
                    identify when a User returns to the webpage. Session ID is stored for 2 days, after which it is
                    automatically deleted.</p>

                <p>Language cookie is used for presetting User’s language preference while using the website.
                    Language
                    cookie is stored for 28 days, after which it is automatically deleted.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Data Controller and Data Processor</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Sportshive highlights that Sportshive does not own, control or direct the use of any of the
                        Personal Data stored or processed by a User via the Service. Only Users are entitled to
                        access,
                        retrieve and direct the use of such data.</li>

                    <li>Sportshive is largely unaware of what Personal Data is actually being stored or made
                        available
                        by a User to the Service. Sportshive does not directly access such data except as authorized
                        by
                        the User or if necessary to provide Services to the Users.</li>

                    <li>Sportshive does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data or the purposes for
                        which
                        Personal Data is collected, therefore Sportshive cannot be considered data controller in
                        terms
                        of the GDPR and does not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR.</li>
                    <li></li>

                    <li>Sportshive should be considered as a processor on behalf of its Users and Clubs.</li>

                    <li>The Clubs and Users are the data controllers under the GDPR, meaning that the Clubs and
                        Users
                        control the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of
                        the
                        purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data</li>

                    <li>Sportshive is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained or other
                        information stored on its (or its subcontractors’) servers nor is Sportshive responsible for
                        the
                        manner in which the User processes such information.</li>
